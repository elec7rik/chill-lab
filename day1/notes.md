# day 1 stuff

- variables (let/const)
- arrays (lists)
- objects (structured data with key : value)
- functions (input/output machines)
- loops (iterate through arrays)
- array of objects = super common shape for detailed lists (like token holdings)
- mini-project that calculates total USD value using static data

## to-remember
- quotes around key name are optional unless they have spaces/special-chars
- commonly key names are unquoted
- don't forget to declare variables(let/const)
- forgetting let makes a global variable which is bad
